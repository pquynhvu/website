## About Me

<body>
  <p align="justify">
    I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida. 
    Prior to joining UFL, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Canada. My 
    current research interests lie at the interface of Bayesian statistics, assumption-free 
    prediction, and uncertainty quantification. In particular, I aim to develop 
    statistical methods that address inferential challenges induced by computational 
    constraints for high-dimensional data and varying-dimension parameter space in 
    Bayesian framework. In my past life, I had conducted research on Markov Chain Monte 
    Carlo, agent-based modeling, and variational Bayes. My CV can be found [here]{uploads/resume.pdf}.

    Non-academic-wise, I really enjoy reading, crocheting, and hiking. I'm also a coffee 
    enthusiast!!
