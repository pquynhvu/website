        I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida (UFL). Prior to 
        joining UFL, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Canada. My current research interests 
        lie at the interface of Bayesian statistics, assumption-free prediction, and uncertainty quantification. 
        In particular, I aim to develop statistical methods that address inferential challenges induced by 
        computational constraints for high-dimensional data and varying-dimension parameter space in Bayesian 
        framework. In my past life, I had conducted research on Markov Chain Monte Carlo, agent-based modeling, 
        and variational Bayes. My CV can be found [here](../uploads/Quynh_resume.pdf).
