        <p align="justify">
          I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida (UFL). Prior to 
          joining UFL, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Canada. My current research interests 
          lie at the interface of Bayesian statistics, assumption-free prediction, and uncertainty quantification. 
          In particular, I aim to develop statistical methods that address inferential challenges induced by 
          computational constraints for high-dimensional data and varying-dimension parameter space in Bayesian 
          framework. In my past life, I had conducted research on Markov Chain Monte Carlo, agent-based modeling, 
          and variational Bayes. 
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Non-academic-wise, I am passionate about improving statistical communication and overall statistical literacy and increasing the representation of women in STEM and other quantitative fields. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, crocheting, and hiking, and I am also a coffee enthusiast!
